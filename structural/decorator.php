/****************************************************************
 * DECORATOR
 * - Also known as: Wrapper.
 * - A structural pattern that allows adding new behaviors to objects dynamically by placing them inside special wrapper objects, called decorators.
 * - Using decorators you can wrap objects countless number of times since both target objects and decorators follow the same interface. The resulting object will get a stacking behavior of all wrappers.
 * - Not to be confused with the Adapter pattern. The decorator pattern essentially extends the class that is being wrapped, whereas, an adapter essentially "converts" the class that is being wrapped so it works with an otherwise incompatible class.
