/****************************************************************
 * STATE
 * - A behavioral design pattern that allows an object to change the behavior when its internal state changes.
 * - The State pattern suggests that you create new classes for all possible states of an object and extract all state-specific behaviors into these classes.
 * - Instead of implementing all behaviors on its own, the original object, called context, stores a reference to one of the state objects that represents its current state, and delegates all the state-related work to that object.
 * - This structure may look similar to the Strategy pattern, but thereâ€™s one key difference. In the State pattern, the particular states may be aware of each other and initiate transitions from one state to another, whereas strategies almost never know about each other.
